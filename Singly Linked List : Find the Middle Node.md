   # ðŸ“š Singly Linked List : Find the Middle Node of a Singly Linked List Using Recursion

This Python program demonstrates how to find the middle node of a singly linked list using recursion. The program calculates the middle element by utilizing two pointers, with one pointer moving one step at a time (slow) and the other moving two steps at a time (fast). When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that:
- Creates a singly linked list.
- Uses recursion to find the middle node of the list.
- In case of an even number of nodes, it returns the second middle element.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Node Class**: 
   - Define a `Node` class to represent each node in the singly linked list. Each node has two attributes: `data` and `next`.
   
2. **LinkedList Class**:
   - Define a `LinkedList` class that manages the linked list with methods to:
     - `append(data)`: Add a new node to the end of the list.
     - `get_middle_recursive(slow, fast)`: A recursive helper function to find the middle node using two pointers (slow and fast).
     - `find_middle()`: A method to call the recursive function and return the middle node's data.

3. **Input**:
   - First, the program reads an integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the linked list.
   - Then, it reads `n` space-separated integers to form the linked list.

4. **Recursive Middle Finding**:
   - The `get_middle_recursive` method uses two pointers to traverse the list:
     - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
     - The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - When the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the middle element. If the list has an even number of nodes, it returns the second middle element.

## ðŸ’» Program
      class Node:
          def __init__(self, data):
              self.data = data
              self.next = None
      
      def find_middle(head, fast=None, slow=None):
          if fast is None:
              fast = slow = head
              if not head:
                  return None
          if fast.next is None or fast.next.next is None:
              return slow
          return find_middle(head, fast.next.next, slow.next)
      
      # Create linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
      head = Node(1)
      head.next = Node(2)
      head.next.next = Node(3)
      head.next.next.next = Node(4)
      head.next.next.next.next = Node(5)
      
      middle = find_middle(head)
      print(middle.data if middle else None)
